Only one Prompt: Manifest a Pomodoro Timer Extension. The timer should take 3 inputs from user they are Work Time, break Time and Number of Laps. Note that: 1 Work Time+1 Break Time= 1 lap. Whenever the user clicks the Start Pomodoro after giving this inputs a timer should start which should now also be visible to user if he clicks the extension. If it's work time then there should be heading of Work Time above the timer and same for Break Time. There also should be a small footer which is showing the current lap number. Make the box size a bit big. Design it in a unique size using Tailwind CSS . Make it feel like the timer of future. Design it in Dark Mode and give it a Glass Morphism like feel.  The extension should give a notification of 'Break Time' when the work time timer ends and 'Work Time' notification when break time timer ends.
